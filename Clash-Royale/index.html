                    <h2>What is Clash Royale?</h2>
                    <p>Clash Royale is a real-time multiplayer game where players collect and upgrade cards featuring Clash of Clans troops, spells, and defenses. The objective is to destroy the opponent's towers while defending your own. Players deploy cards onto the battlefield using elixir, which regenerates over time. The game features various modes, including 1v1 battles, 2v2 battles, and special events. Players can join clans to share cards and participate in clan wars. Strategy and quick decision-making are key to winning battles and climbing the ranks in this fast-paced game.</p>

                    <h2>Card Types</h2>
                    <p>In Clash Royale, there are five main types of cards: Troops, Spells, Buildings, Champions, and Heroics. Troops are units that can be deployed on the battlefield to attack enemy structures and defend your own. Spells are magical abilities that can be cast to damage enemies or support your troops. Buildings are structures that can be placed on the battlefield to defend against enemy attacks or generate resources. Champions are powerful units with unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle. Heroics are troops gaining the unique ability to have powers like Champions. Each card has its own elixir cost, rarity, and level, which affect its performance in battles.</p>

            <h1>Progression & Arenas</h1>
            <p>In Clash Royale, the arena system is the core of your progression. As you battle other players and earn trophies, you climb through a series of unique arenas—each with its own theme, difficulty level, and card unlocks. Every arena represents a new milestone in your journey and rewards you with access to stronger cards, better chests, and more advanced strategies. Progressing through the arenas isn't just about winning matches—it's about learning how the game evolves. Early arenas introduce basic units and spells, while higher arenas unlock complex mechanics, advanced troops, and meta-defining cards. As you climb, matchmaking becomes more competitive, pushing you to refine your deck, time your elixir efficiently, and adapt to different playstyles. Whether you're a beginner learning the fundamentals or a veteran aiming for Legendary Arena, the arena roadmap is your guide through Clash Royale's competitive ladder.
